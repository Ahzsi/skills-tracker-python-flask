# Skills & Projects Tracker

This is a simple web app built with Python and Flask. It lets you list the **skills** you're learning and the **projects** you've worked on. When you click on a skill, it filters the projects to show only the ones that use that skill. You can run it on your own computer or publish it online for free using a service called [Render](https://render.com).

## How to Add Your Own Skills & Projects

### 1. Open `app.py`
    At the top, you'll see a dictionary named `tracker`. It has two parts:
    - `skills`: a list of strings
    - `projects`: a list of dictionaries, each describing one project

### 2. To add a skill:
    Just add the skill name to the skills list

### 3. To add a project:
    Each project needs:
    - A title
    - The technologies used (comma-separated)
    - A link to your code or live site
    - Example: 
        {
            "title": "My Portfolio",
            "tech": "HTML, CSS, JavaScript",
            "link": "https://your-portfolio.com"
        }
